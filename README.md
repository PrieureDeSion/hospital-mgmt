This repository contains the codes for a Hospital Management System, based on a simple terminal-UI, for the course project of Data Structures and ALgortihms (CS213). More information on this project can be found in [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u97YE9mN5PKUCfA0kbaawPLDp81N3-f_Hf9G7Bx0KU/edit?usp=sharing) or [here](Presentation.pdf).

To interact with the ultra-light and user-friendly GUI, shoot a terminal and

```sh
g++ --std=c++11 -o interface.out interface.cpp
./interface.out
```
